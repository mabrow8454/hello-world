My name is Matt Brown

And I'm figuring this out, I think

Yes I most definitely am!!!

## 🌍 Earth-Moon Orbital System

An interactive 3D visualization of the Earth-Moon orbital system with accurate scales and rotation periods!

### Features

- **Accurate Scale Model**: Real proportions for Earth (12,742 km), Moon (3,474 km), and their distance (384,400 km)
- **Realistic Orbital Mechanics**: Moon completes orbit in 27.3 days, Earth rotates every 24 hours
- **Beautiful 3D Graphics**: Built with Three.js for smooth WebGL rendering
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Mouse drag to rotate view
  - Scroll to zoom in/out
  - Adjustable simulation speed (1x to 5000x)
  - Play/Pause and Reset controls
- **Real-time Moon Phases**: Shows current moon phase based on orbital position
- **Starfield Background**: Thousands of stars for an immersive space experience

### How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No installation required!

```bash
# If you have Python installed, you can run a local server:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
